# Spotidude Telegram Bot

A telegram bot to manage your chat's music needs.


## How To Use
1. Add the bot to the group chat
2. type `/create_playlist "SONG NAME HERE"` into the chat

That's it. Now you can share Spotify song links and they'll be automatically added to the playlist.
You will need your own account with Spotify to be able to listen to the playlist. 

### You can run commands like 
- `/get_playlist` : This will get you the link for the spotify playlist

Make sure to follow the playlist so you can easily access the playlist.

The playlists are public, so anyone can potentially access them. However, songs can only be added via the group chat, as the bot is the only one that can manage the playlist.
